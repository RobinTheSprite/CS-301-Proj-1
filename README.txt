~NASM I/O Madness by Mark Underwood~
This program, in its present state, can do a few different things:
	1. Open and close files,
	2. Print the strings written inside a text file,
	3. Take each byte from a binary file, convert it into a character, and print it to the screen.

Currently, the program runs and operates the way I want it to. I have not subjected it to any kind of exhaustive testing.
In future, I would like to take the strings that are in the binary file and put them in the text file, and vice versa.
